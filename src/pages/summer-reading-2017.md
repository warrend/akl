I've been in a season so far this year where I've wanted to escape into books, but the drive to write about them has disappeared for a little while. Since January there has been so much for me to work out in my regular life that writing about my reading life took a backseat. That being said, I've read some amazing books so far, and wanted to mention them in case you were looking for some perspective-changing books this summer. And, of course, I'll share the books I'm planning on reading this summer--which, I think, will be a little bit lighter than what I've read most of this year. If this isn't enough for you, I have ten summers of reading you can check out here. I wish you a summer that has a piece of this kind of joy: [![](http://akindoflibrary.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_1525-300x225.jpg)](http://akindoflibrary.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_1525.jpg) [![](http://akindoflibrary.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_1378-1-300x300.jpg)](http://akindoflibrary.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_1378-1.jpg)[![](http://akindoflibrary.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3559-1-e1496096970239-225x300.jpg)](http://akindoflibrary.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3559-1.jpg) [![](http://akindoflibrary.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3614-300x225.jpg)](http://akindoflibrary.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3614.jpg) **Books I Loved, Should Have Written About, That You Should Absolutely Read** While I typed this I realized that the most poignant books I read so far this year were about race. For so many reasons, I think it absolutely necessary to read voices and perspectives that are not one's own.  (I'm linking to amazon for ease, but by all means, please show some love for your local independent bookstore): [March Books 1-3 by John Lewis](http://akindoflibrary.com/read-now-march/): I actually did write about this book. It gave so much history and context to the protests of the Civil Rights Movement. Brilliant. [Homegoing](https://www.amazon.com/Homegoing-novel-Yaa-Gyasi/dp/1101947136): Brilliant. Should be required reading for humans that chronicles the future generations of two girls from Ghana, one who stays and one who is sold into slavery. [The Underground Railroad](https://www.amazon.com/Underground-Railroad-Novel-Colson-Whitehead/dp/1524736309): Powerful and necessary. Follows an escaped slave as she journeys north. [Born a Crime](https://www.amazon.com/Born-Crime-Stories-African-Childhood-ebook/dp/B01DHWACVY/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1496094716&sr=1-1&keywords=born+a+crime+trevor+noah): Trevor Noah's memoir was simultaneously laugh out loud funny and an important education about life in South Africa pre and post Apartheid [The Hate You Give](https://www.amazon.com/Hate-U-Give-Angie-Thomas/dp/0062498533/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1496094842&sr=1-1&keywords=the+hate+you+give+by+angie+thomas): One of the best Young Adult novels I've read in a long time. This one tackles race in a nuaced, powerful way and I couldn't recommend it more highly (also try pairing it with [All American Boys](https://www.amazon.com/All-American-Boys-Jason-Reynolds/dp/1481463330/ref=pd_sim_14_4?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1481463330&pd_rd_r=PDXVHK8QT1NYT1F3SEW9&pd_rd_w=u4z7N&pd_rd_wg=efzsB&psc=1&refRID=PDXVHK8QT1NYT1F3SEW9)\--both should be required reading for teenagers and adults alike). **Summer Reading List** Many of these have been on my to-read list for a few years. I always lean more into mystery in the summer, and am looking for books that feel a little bit lighter than what I've been reading lately--literally and figuratively! These are all in paperback!
