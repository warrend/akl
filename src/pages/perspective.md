Flying  
over the geometric city at night  
made me imagine  
we were actually in a tiny, tiny plane  
skimming the surface  
of a gold encrusted jewel.  
The wind  
or the Christmas lights  
made it appear to be  
twinkling.  
And the dark spaces became  
less river and road  
and more the recesses  
between the gems.  
Maybe  
we were just gliding  
above  
the pendent worn by  
a great queen,  
unaware of our  
smallness.
