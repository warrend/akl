The weather said  
it was supposed  
to rain.  
It didn't.  
(I don't think,  
anyway)  
But the clouds  
pressed down  
and left,  
the concrete imprinted  
with their heaviness.  
  
The edges are evaporating  
though.  
And  
the ground is just warm enough  
because those vapors smell  
like urban spring--  
the concrete washed and (almost) clean.
