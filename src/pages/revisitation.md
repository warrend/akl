I searched my blog because last year I wrote about an article I wanted to send to some friends. I laughed when I realized that I wrote [the post](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2008/01/better-view-of-winter.html) almost exactly a year ago, while struggling with the same seasonal affective demons I have currently. So I thought it would share because it seemed relatively hopeful.
