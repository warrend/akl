I came across this poem this morning while reading one of my [favorite blogs](http://www.readingmytealeaves.com/).  It was timely because in my graduate class this week we were discussing poetry and I realized how much I had been missing it lately.  There is no other form that can capture so much with so little and, like the nerdy English teacher that I am, it hurts my soul that it is such a misunderstood genre.  I try to teach my students that poetry is one of the most powerful ways to share their voice--it distills the most power and leaves out the unnecessary that clogs so many texts.    
  
I've been talking with some people lately--and even in my last [post](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2013/04/looking-for-beauty-and-remembering-how.html)\--about living thankfully and gratefully, especially for the intangible.  This poem made me stop and think and breathe.  And it makes me want to write.

**Under the Magnolia by Carolyn Miller  
**  
I give thanks because I do not have  
a great sorrow. My village has not  
burned, my child has not died, my body  
is not ravaged. I sit here on the ground  
lucky, lucky. Somewhere, villages are burning,  
somewhere, not too far away, children  
are dying; in this great urban park  
painstakingly constructed over sand dunes,  
people live in the flowering bushes. But  
just here, in front of me, is a bride and groom;  
here is a child running with  
a red ball; another child is rolling on  
the grass. All I have to do is to decide  
how much fear to let inside my heart  
in this fragile, created place, this bowl of grass  
surrounded by palms and cypresses and  
shaggy-barked cedars and trees  
whose names I do not know, long fronds  
falling, clusters of lilac fruits depending like  
bouquets. All we can do is trust  
that we belong here with the flowers: white  
iris and Iceland poppies, a blur  
of primroses, beds where flowers are  
a crowd of color, where they close in the dark,  
where the first light finds them starred  
with dew. The trees seem to know  
what I do not know; even the cultivated grass  
understands some chain of being I can only  
guess at, whether it is God’s mind, or  
the erotic body of the Goddess, or some  
abstract kind of love, or  
some longing for existence that includes  
the fern trees, the new buds of cones on the  
conifers, the white butterflies, the skating boys,  
the hooked new buds of the magnolia  
that look like claws holding on  
to life, the curved thick petals of magnolia  
in the grass, some gone to rust, some creased,  
some streaked, others freckled, others magenta  
at the curved stem end, others cracked,  
all lined with long veins branching out  
to the petal’s edge.
