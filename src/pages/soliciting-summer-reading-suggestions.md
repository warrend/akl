I typically get a little over zealous in the number of books I can read in the summer, but I do have a lot of time. Books I'm considering right now:  
  
A Fine Balance by Rohinton Mistry  
The Time Traveler's Wife by Audrey Niffenegger  
The Hobbit By J.R.R. Tolkien  
1984 by George Orwell  
The Savage Detectives by Roberto Bolano  
The House of Spirits by Isabel Allende  
American Pastoral by Philip Roth
