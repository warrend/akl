Officially summer starts June 20 though people have been in summer mode since Memorial Day, but mine starts June 28th.  Mt first day off school.  I love my job for a lot of reasons, but especially for the glorious time to [get lost in a crazy amount of books for 8 weeks every year](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/search/label/summer%20reading).  Last year my book club committed to a tiny type 1,000+ page book which was great, but [consumed my summer reading](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2011/09/infinite-jest-very-general-response-to.html) life, so this year I'm looking forward to more freedom. The end of the school year is also always so hectic, so I am looking forward to thinking a bit more deeply in the coming months, [which was an upside to last summer](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2011/08/we-tipped-over-half-way-point-for.html).  Here's the list so far, but I'm still soliciting recommendations and leaving some room for spontaneous decisions, obviously.  
  

**From my ongoing book list**

{summer reading start}

I have been compiling a list on my phone of book titles I come across browsing in my favorite bookstores, in magazines and on blogs that sound compelling.  On Sunday I walked over to my favorite bookstore in Brooklyn, [Greenlight](http://greenlightbookstore.com/), and went through the list and picked out the four that made me the most excited to get started with the reading plan:  
  
1\. _A Short History of Women_ by Kate Walbert: this has been on my mental list for years and chronicles the story of five generations of women and studies the relationship of mothers and daughters.  
  
2\. _Broken Colors_ by Michele Zackheim: from one of my favorite imprints, Europa (see [The Elegance of the Hedgehog](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2009/06/kindred-souls.html) and [A Novel Bookstore](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2012/02/perfect-vacation-book-for-lover-of.html)), this story is written up as lyrically beautiful and historically set, two of my favorite kinds of books.  It follows a woman's life through her artistic passions.  
  
3\. _Stone's Fall_ by Iain Pears: a highly recommended mystery set in London, Paris and Venice, told backward in time from 1909 to 1867.  
  
4\. _Everything Beautiful Began After_ by Simon Van Booy:  three characters' paths cross one summer in Athens  
  

**Young Adult**

{young adult non fiction}  
  
  

Of course, I have a few titles I want to read for the youth.  This summer, I'm trying to focus on some of the new non fiction I have in my classroom that I'm hoping to use in book clubs in the fall.  These titles range from a graphic novel version of the 9/11 report to one about Charles Darwin and his wife.  Sometimes I get a little leery of reading too much young adult fiction in the summertime, but I'm excited for what these titles could do for kids as readers.  Initially I hoped to be done with all of them by the end of June, but I think that's a bit lofty of a goal. Ha.

  

**Recommendations and Rereads**

_Geek Love_ and _Ender's Game_ from Nikki

reread _Danny, the Champion of the World_ from Jenna

I always reread _[The Summer Book](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2010/08/my-favorite-summer-book-of-all-time-i.html)_  

  

So, I'll be writing along the way from Brooklyn, Louisville and the Hamptons this year, with an [overview](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/search/label/summer%20reading%20conclusion) in September.  If you want to read along, let me know, because I am always up for book talks:)
