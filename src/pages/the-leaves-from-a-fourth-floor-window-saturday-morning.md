I need to rush.  
I'm in fear  
all the yellow leaves will lose their grasp  
before I can write.  
Their brightness  
against the gray sky and brown stone and cement  
makes my heart ache.  
A few take shelter on window ledges  
or master the art of traveling as the crow flies  
for blocks at a time.  
They want to stay  
for a little longer, I think  
with my fingers crossed.
