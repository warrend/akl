I've been talking for a while about how I really want to start re-doing furniture...finding treasures for low cost that need a little bit of work and allow me to use some creative power. About a month ago, I literally walked into my reason for starting: two worn but loveable chairs on the sidewalk for free! (This is fairly normal in my neighborhood in Brooklyn. Please don't be skeeved.) So here's what I did:

1\. I cleaned, primed and painted the chairs black. (2 hours, $5)  
2\. I ordered fabric from Repot Depot (15 minutes, $7)  
3\. I purchased a staple gun! (5 minutes, $16 but reuseable, so I'm not including cost)  
4\. I purchased staples for the gun (1 minute, 15 cents)  
5\. I recovered the seats with an under layer of fabric and then the fabric you see. (30 minutes)
