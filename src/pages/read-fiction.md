While flying to my parents house in Louisville for Thanksgiving, my mind filled with news stories of late, I was reading _A Constellation of Vital Phenomenon_, a story about war-torn Chechnya, and found myself thinking about how little I actually know about the struggles of mankind.  I may know some overarching themes about global conflicts, but I realized those don't carry the same weight without understanding the lives of the people living there. Locally, there have been moments of flipping through news stations the past few weeks when my jaw hit the ground as people tried to turn people's lives and loss into a theory about taxes or the choosing to look only for political theory in the pain of others. The more I thought, the more I realized how thankful I am to the authors who have shared the stories of people I probably won't have the opportunity to meet.  Reading fiction (or narrative non-fiction) has enabled me to go inside the life and mind and emotions of characters whose life experience is completely different from mine. This has changed my life. Literally. So, I decided to revisit some old posts and make a list of the books I've read over the years that helped me to see the world beyond my day-to-day concerns, to meet other humans who struggle, to know lands and conflicts that helped me understand, even if just a little bit more, the pain people face in our world.  These are some of the stories that have stayed with me (some go pretty far back and it was interesting to see how much I've changed since I wrote some of these posts--I was just 26 when this blog journey started). I'd love to hear others you would recommend--I'm hoping to spend some time in 2014 intentionally reading the world--which would actually be a great book club. **Adult Books** [Prayers for the Stolen](http://akindoflibrary.com/prayers/) by Jennifer Clement [Let the Great World Spin](http://akindoflibrary.com/let-the-great-world-spin/) by Colum McCann [A Fine Balance](http://akindoflibrary.com/looking-for-beauty-and-remembering-how-to-live/) by Rohinton MIstry [Beloved](http://akindoflibrary.com/the-pain-of-beloved/) by Toni Morrison Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison [What is the What](http://akindoflibrary.com/what/) by Dave Eggers Cry, The Beloved Country by Alan Paton [The Beautiful Things that Heaven Bears](http://akindoflibrary.com/summer-reading-conclusion-3/) by Dinaw Mengestu [Flight Behavior](http://akindoflibrary.com/flight-behavior/) by Barbara Kingsolver [Wave](http://akindoflibrary.com/literature-and-loss-wave/) by Sonali Deraniyagala [Night](http://akindoflibrary.com/maus-and-night-think-through-wwii-and-literature-with-my-8th-graders/) by Elie Wiesel [The Inheritance of Loss](http://akindoflibrary.com/stop-scuttling/) by Kiran Desai **Young Adult books** (important for adults who wish to broaden their understanding of teenagers, and for teenagers to feel like they have allies in life) I am J by Cris Beam [The Perks of Being a Wallflower](http://akindoflibrary.com/the-art-and-psychology-of-mixed-tapes-and-belonging/) by Stephen Chbosky [Everyday](http://akindoflibrary.com/the-gift-of-solitude-applicable-to-all-adults-as-described-in-a-young-adult-novel/) by David Levithan [Brown Girl Dreaming](http://akindoflibrary.com/brown-girl-dreaming/) by Jacqueline Woodson The Miseducation of Cameron Post by Emily M.
