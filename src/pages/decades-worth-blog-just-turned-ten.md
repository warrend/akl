Ten years ago (yesterday) I wrote [my first blog post](http://akindoflibrary.com/we-demand-windows/) in an effort to do more thinking about my reading and to get comfortable with sharing my writing. For some context, my favorite dance songs included SexyBack by Justin Timberlake, SOS by Rihanna, and The Fray was having a hell of a year. This was the year iphones were introduced, the year I joined Facebook, and blogging was relatively new (and I was over at [blogspot](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2007/01/we-demand-windows.html), where all the cool kids were at the time). For the record, I was also living in the only NYC apartment I've ever had with a dishwasher. I was 26. Looking back, there were years I wrote a post every single Saturday and covered every single book I read. Other years, I was lucky to write once a month. What remains true, no matter how often I write, is that reading broadens my world and I can think of no better way toward empathy and understanding on the micro and macro levels. Last January I gave myself [a challenge](http://akindoflibrary.com/decades-worth-rereading-favorites-blogs-tenth-year/) to reread ten of the books I claim as favorites. I revisit books like _Harry Potter_ and _Anne of Green Gables_ on a regular basis, but not much else. The shelves of the bookstores are usually too tempting to slow down and linger in something I've already read. So, I wanted to revisit the books that impacted me the most--and I absolutely loved it. Revisiting my favorite books felt like spending time with a great friend I haven't seen in years. It was also interesting to see look at old notes and things I underlined--how different parts resonated with me now, but some things things remained just as striking. Here's a round-up of what I had to say throughout the year: [Hunting and Gathering by Anna Gavalda](http://akindoflibrary.com/reread-1-hunting-and-gathering/) [The God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy](http://akindoflibrary.com/year-ten-reread-2-the-god-of-small-things/)  [The Waves by Virginia Woolf](http://akindoflibrary.com/time-decided-good-idea-reread-waves-virginia-woolf-just-took-month-longer-undergrad/) [Great House by Nicole Krauss](http://akindoflibrary.com/longing-loneliness-rereading-great-house-nicole-krauss/) [Everything Beautiful Began After by Simon Van Booy](http://akindoflibrary.com/everything-beautiful-began/) [The Elegance of the Hedgehog by Muriel Barbery](http://akindoflibrary.com/the-elegance-of-the-hedgehog/) [](http://akindoflibrary.com/the-elegance-of-the-hedgehog/) [The House on Mango Street by Sandra Cisneros](http://akindoflibrary.com/sleeping-close-stars-rereading-house-mango-street/) [Persepolis by Marjane Satrapi](http://akindoflibrary.com/persepolis/)  Beloved by Toni Morrison If you're going the math, you'll realize I reread 9 books. I laughed out loud because I only realized it five minutes ago. When I decided to change up the last few books to diversify, I mixed up my counting. My over achiever self hates it, but the part of me that's trying to give up a bit of control is laughing that I messed up an assignment I gave myself. I also had to accept that I didn't write about Beloved (there is so much to think about and such an important book--I recommend it so much not despite of, but because of the devastating issues within it). I did write about it the first time around [here](http://akindoflibrary.com/?s=beloved).  Here's to more grace in 2017! Speaking of this year, my reading goal is to read more books that help me get to know perspectives and cultures different than my own, which I wrote about in my post about _The House on Mango Street_. I don't think it's naive of me to say that if we all read more, the world would be a better place.
