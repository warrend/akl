I've been wanting to write about one of my favorite parts of summer, and since I just finished making my way through [Mary Oliver](http://akindoflibrary.com/category/mary-oliver/)'s New and Selected Poems: Volume 1, I figured it was the perfect time. One of the conclusions I've come to about maintaining sanity while busy is how necessary it is to slow down and connect with the things that make us feel alive. I've written a lot about the stress of my last year (school-year time, not calendar) and the different ways my summer helped me crawl out of that anxiety-ridden time. In the middle of August I drove some friends to northern Michigan to where one of them has spent time every summer since childhood. The five days of our trip were spent doing all the things I love: driving on country roads with good music, buying copious amounts of produce and cider donuts from road side stands, the sounds of the woods, starring at water, riding in a boat, cooking and drinking wine, and being amazed at nature. \[caption id="attachment\_1838" align="alignnone" width="300"\][![image2](http://akindoflibrary.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image2-300x300.jpg)](http://akindoflibrary.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image2.jpg) The Cottage Book Shop, Anna's boat, Sleeping Bear Dunes, Cherry Republic\[/caption\] One of the highlights was going to the studio of local artist [Gwen Frostic](https://www.gwenfrostic.com/), who passed away in 2001, but whose studio has been kept up and running. She created woodblock prints inspired by the landscape around her, and their stunning simplicity was a perfect pairing for my love affair with the words of Mary Oliver; both are inspired by not just nature, but nature's capacity for healing and reflection. **From "Morning Poem"**  _each pond with its blazing lilies_ _is a prayer heard and answered_ _lavishly,_ _every morning,_ whether or not you have ever dared to be happy, whether or not you have ever dared to pray. \[caption id="attachment\_1840" align="alignnone" width="300"\][![Two of the dozen Gwen Frostic woodblock prints I couldn't walk away without. ](http://akindoflibrary.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image1-1-300x300.jpg)](http://akindoflibrary.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image1-1.jpg) Two of the dozen Gwen Frostic woodblock prints I couldn't walk away without.\[/caption\] **From "Starfish":** It never grew easy, but at last I grew peaceful: all summer my fear diminished as they bloomed through the water like flowers, like flecks of an uncertain dream, while I lay on the rocks, reaching into the darkness, learning little by little to love our only world. A few weeks later, I drove upstate to Windflower Farm for their CSA campout with a dear friend and along the way we ate at my favorite restaurant of all time, dropped in on a show by the inspiring artist [Lisa Congdon](http://lisacongdon.com/blog/), and drank up the farmlands around the Hudson River Valley. We spent so much time talking about how it was worth it to go out of our way to see Lisa's show, and to talk to Maggie at her cafe, and to be with Farmer Ted on his land: being around people who create inspires creation. \[caption id="attachment\_1837" align="alignnone" width="300"\][![Maggie's Krooked Cafe, artist Lisa Congdon, Windflower Farm](http://akindoflibrary.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image1-300x300.jpg)](http://akindoflibrary.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image1.jpg) Maggie's Krooked Cafe, artist Lisa Congdon, Windflower Farm\[/caption\] Insert school and grad school starting right after the farm trip. Needless to say, I rareIy had time to slow down and create. I'm tired of this being my story of a school year. When I felt tired, I sat on the couch and tried to catch up on The Good Wife in the name of "relaxation". Nothing against The Good Wife (you know I love my shows), but even though I was technically relaxing, my soul didn't feel alive. Thankfully, Daniel and I went on a walk to Prospect Park this morning and talked almost the whole time about art ([please look at his work](http://www.danielwarren.xyz)) and cultivating a life that helps create it. I found myself snapping pictures of leaves and trees I wanted to draw. It's amazing how if I do the things I truly love, my desire to create increases. And in turn, I feel more full. And relaxed. And alive. So, my goal for this favorite season of my life is to choose to spend time walking to the park or to the river. To not let tiredness or busyness be an excuse for the kind of relaxation that doesn't really relax in the end. I've been reading a lot about the art of attention: being present and noticing the beauty of life around me. Hopefully that will weave its way into it all, too.
