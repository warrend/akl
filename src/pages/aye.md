Every now and then, even an English teacher feels that paragraphs are just too much.  
  
List One: I feel compelled to share the reason for my prolonged absence. The reasons include, but are not limited to:  
1\. The pile on my desk that had 90 literary essays, 90 book responses and 90 memoirs all written by my darling 12 year olds.  
2\. My inability to ever say no to anything. (I have made progress on this, hence the reason I am writing this now.)  
3\. A roommate transition here at 90 W.  
4\. The planning involved in teaching the youth how to read and write well. (Meaning remembering to capitalize names. Seriously.)  
  
List Two: Things that have happened today to allow me to write even this post:  
1\. Skipped basketball practice.  
2\. Skipped book club.  
3\. Skipped X rays.  
4\. (Regretfully but necessarily) skipped dinner with a dear friend.  
  
List Three: Joys of this evening:  
1\. Getting the last of the literary essays graded.  
2\. Grading 30 of the book responses.  
3\. Making a real dinner.  
4\. Listening to "All at Sea" on repeat (yes, Jamie Cullum. yes, I love it) and wishing I were on a plane to Ireland.  
5\. Talking to one of my best friends from high school about my trip to the great state of Ohio this weekend!  
  
That's all I got. If you are looking for something literary and/or deep, you will have to wait a little longer. I'm not short on ideas, just time.
