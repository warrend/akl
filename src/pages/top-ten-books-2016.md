It was a year where we focused on things closer to home, one of the most significant being our little dog Penny, who became ours in August. Other major highlights included graduating from my Literacy Specialist program and the Cavaliers winning the NBA ![](http://akindoflibrary.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_3267-300x225.jpg)championship (!!!).  But of course the reading highlights. I will dedicate an entire post to this, but I did reread ten of my favorite books, which I loved. This year, my reading goal is to read more about people who are less like me, and read more books that are set around the world. I think it is so important to get to know others through literature. The following ten were the ones that stand out the most (and here are [2007-2015](http://akindoflibrary.com/category/year-in-review/), if you still need some more ideas):   [![](http://akindoflibrary.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4051-300x200.jpg)](http://akindoflibrary.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4051.jpg)[City on Fire](http://akindoflibrary.com/city-on-fire/): I technically started this at the end of 2015, but didn't finish it until January. My book club read this much-hyped story with dozens of characters who are living slightly interconnected lives in New York City in the height of the 70s, with the climax of the story occurring during the infamous blackout in the summer of 1977. [The Signature of All Things](http://akindoflibrary.com/1909-2/) by Elizabeth Gilbert: Another book club choice, Glibert’s book tells the life story of Alma Whitaker, a (fictional) botanist born in 1800 whose scientific mind is challenged by the spiritual. This book is for people who love to know and get lost in a character's entire story, as it covers her birth to death. [A Little Life](http://akindoflibrary.com/1914-2/) by Hanya Yanagihara: The story begins by following 4 college roommates, each with a different background, all now living in New York City trying to make it in their chosen fields. That description sounds like Friends, but this is a dark, grave story. I felt immersed in the characters' lives and found myself thinking considerably about relationships, grace, and the ability to move on from tragedy. All American Boys by Jason Reynolds and Brandon Kiehly: This is hands-down the best young adult novel I read all year and also the most important for teenagers and adults alike. It starts with a moment of police brutality and switches between two narrators, one white who witnessed what happened to the other, who is black. So thought-provoking and so relevant. American Wife by Curtis Sittenfeld: This hypothetical imagining of the life of Laura Bush was another book club pick. Sittenfeld's writing is exceptional and I was completely drawn into this story, and I think anyone would be no matter what your political leanings. I found it fascinating. Salt by Nayirah Waheed: This book of poetry floored me. Waheed's voice is fresh, urgent, and striking. I actually couldn't find this collection in any of my local stores--I think she is gaining quite a following, so hopefully it will be there soon. It's worth tracking down! And very readable, if you are thinking of dipping your toes into poetry for the first time. I can't wait to share some of her work with my students in our poetry unit. (Speaking of poetry, I also read Mary Oliver's New and Selected Poems Volume 2 and her latest book of essays Upstream, both of which I loved. However, I've written about her so much, that I thought I should share the poetry love. She is an excellent introduction to poetry as well.) Imagine Me Gone by Adam Haslett: I actually can't believe I didn't write about this book, because I had two pages of notes going into our book club meeting. It told from the perspective of various family members as they deal with the effects of depression on 2 of the 5 members. It is so powerful and poignant, and though dark, also darkly comical and I laughed out loud a few times. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child by JK Rowling, Jack Thorne, and John Tiffany: This was a highly anticipated read of my summer because I was in need of some literary escapism. I forced myself to parcel out its 4 acts over as many mornings on my fire escape. It wasn't without problems--but even so, it brought a lot of joy to my summer. The parent/child themes I thought were incredibly well done. [Great House](http://akindoflibrary.com/longing-loneliness-rereading-great-house-nicole-krauss/) by Nicole Krauss: This was one of the books I chose to reread, and I wasn't disappointed. I started by reading the four pages of notes I found tucked inside it, and really savored the whole book. What Krauss attempts to do in this book is pretty immense–there are four narratives that are connected only by the fact that at some point one of the characters in each owned an enormous desk that took on a metaphorical life of its own–to a point where it represented a deep kind of loneliness. [The Elegance of the Hedgehog](http://akindoflibrary.com/the-elegance-of-the-hedgehog/) by Muriel Barbery: This was another reread, and I was devastated when it was over. Philosophical and beautiful, I'm certain I'll be coming back to the alternating narrative of 12 year old Paloma and 54 year old Renee many more times.
