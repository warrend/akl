_Good things_: drinking tea. wearing a hooded sweatshirt on a 65 degree August Monday morning. the windows wide open.  
  
I just checked [my list of books](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2009/06/soliciting-summer-reading-suggestions.html) I wanted to read this summer and checked off \*one\* of them. Ha. This is not to say I didn't read this summer, but my plans went awry...

Even though school doesn't officially start until after Labor Day, this week is going to be filled with prep work. I still get beginning of the school year anxiety, but I confess that I am kind of excited to meet the 90 kids I will be spending at least 1500 hours with over the course of the next 9 months. And. I love that my job is to get kids excited about reading and writing. I love asking kids what their absolute favorite book they have ever read it. And yours?
