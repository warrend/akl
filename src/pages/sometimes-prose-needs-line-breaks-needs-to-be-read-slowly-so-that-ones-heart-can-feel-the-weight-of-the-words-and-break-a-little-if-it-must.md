title: Sometimes prose needs line breaks, needs to be read slowly, so that one's heart can feel the weight of the words and break a little, if it must.

"Well,  
that's how thick   
I am,   
I never knew how   
to want   
what everyone wants.    
I only   
thought   
to look for a home, some place   
to be taken in.   
Handing over a crumpled heart,   
seeing it dropped   
in the wastepaper basket  
every   
time."   
  
  
(written as prose on page 473, _The Lacuna_ by Barbara Kingsolver)
