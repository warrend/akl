tonight i walked home  
and i noticed  
that the seasons changed.  
i was thankful  
for my mittens  
and thinking it was time  
for a hat perhaps.  
and i wasn't scared  
of the cold wind  
maybe because in my neighborhood  
i can smell fire places  
and the trees cover the streets  
and the leaves falling down  
are more of a dance  
than a goodbye.
