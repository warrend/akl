Most of my time this summer will be spent here in the city. Since I have the best job ever, I will have lots of TIME to read lots of books! Overly ambitious? Perhaps. But composing this list makes me giddy.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
1\. Eclipse by Stephenie Meyer: This is the third book in the young adult Twilight series that I have been raving about in many previous posts. The fourth and final book comes out in August.  
  
2\. Franny and Zooey by J.D. Salinger: How I haven't read this already is beyond me. Period.  
  
3\. Chronicle of a Death Foretold by Gabriel Garcia Marquez: not only do I love hispanic fiction and have been meaning to read GGM for a long time, I am intriged by the genre of magical realism.  
  
4\. Before we were Free by Julia Alvarez: A coming of age story set in the Dominican Repubic in 1960.  
  
5\. The Book Thief by Markus Zusak: This book I'm reading with my 8th grade ELA team! Death is the narrator in this book set in World War Two era Germany.  
  
6\. Sula by Toni Morrison: I'm excited to try to wrap my head around the difficult issues in this book about friendship, rebellion and morals  
  
7\. Rape, A Love Story by Joyce Carol Oates. Recommended by colleagues as gritty, provocative and thought provoking.  
  
8\. A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini: haven't read Hosseini's follow up to The Kite Runner yet  
  
9\. My Sister's Keeper by Jodi Picoult: My students love this book and she seems like a good jump from Young Adult Fiction into Adult fiction  
  
Others that are waiting on my bookshelf:  
  
Same Kind of Different As Me by Ron Hall and Denver Moore  
The Corrections by Jonathan Franzen  
Trail of Crumbs by Kim Sunee  
The Things They Carried by Tim O'Brien  
  
Books I want to reread for the sheer joy of it:  
  
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows by JK Rowling  
The God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy  
A History of Love by Nicole Krauss  
To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee
