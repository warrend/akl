Obviously, women are objectified in advertising every day. But when I saw this add in Elle Decor, I was truly disgusted. I don't have enough time for all the words to explain my anger, and I will save you from that diatribe. Is it naive of me to think that art directors for advertising campaigns would have more of a conscience? Women tied and bound to sell high end tile? Really? Sick.
