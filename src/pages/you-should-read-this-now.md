I randomly revisited David Foster Wallace's [commencement speech](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122178211966454607.html) for Kenyon College that he gave in 2005.  It is the best text I have read in a long time and at the same time heartbreaking, knowing that he died three years later.   You might click on the link and think that it's too long, or think that it requires too much mental gymnastics for a Friday afternoon, but I don't think you'll be disappointed.
