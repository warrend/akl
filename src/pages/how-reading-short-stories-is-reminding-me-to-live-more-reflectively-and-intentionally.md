I was drawn to this book because it seeks to explore the moment's that shape women's identity as women.  In hindsight, I wish I had read it slowly, as there wasn't an overall character arc for each character, but a few snapshots of their lives.

This summer I read _[Everything Beautiful Began After](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2012/07/on-beauty-and-rebuilding-from.html)_ by Simon Van Booy and fell in love with his rich, poetic style of prose.  While on a walk through the West Village I found a collection of his short stories called _The Secret Lives of People in Love_ and began making my way through them.  What I've learned, though, is that for me, short stories for me are best read slowly and sporadically.  If I read them as a novel, I don't take the tim![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_GvLBy_Amp5I/TB-Y7AJHyMI/AAAAAAAAIH8/2gSin1Grwro/s200/The+Secret+Lives+of+People+in+Love+(HarperPerennial).jpg)e to stop and think about what the author is trying to say in each one or mull over the small details that speak into human existence. One thing I've been thinking about recently is that I am more grounded as a person when I'm letting my reading wash over my mind and impact the way I'm looking at the world.  I read through the first 13 of Van Booy's 19 stories so quickly that my brain didn't have time to consider the weight of lines like: "Without memory, he thought, man would be invincible." One of the reason's I bought Schappell's book was because I wanted to think about how the female identity is formed--especially as I am teaching girls at such a critical developmental stage and stocking my library with books that they will be reading and thinking about.
