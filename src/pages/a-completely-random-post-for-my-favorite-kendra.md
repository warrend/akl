I'm mid book and without much to say. Hence a few thoughts written to the heart-hurting gorgeous heirloom tomato I cut open tonight:[![](http://www.tomatocasual.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/climate.jpg)](http://www.tomatocasual.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/climate.jpg)  
  
Not like others,  
Your poppy-like red insides  
surprised me  
and I wanted to frame you  
and your many intricate caverns and veins  
furnished with generations  
of farmers and their fields past.  
Don't I always say that I want  
the beauty  
to be a part of me?  
  
So I ate.
