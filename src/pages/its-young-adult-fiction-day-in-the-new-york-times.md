Not really, but there were two pretty interesting articles on a couple of the most popular books among my female students:  
  
[The Twilight Series  
](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/12/opinion/12colllins.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin)Writer Gail Collins looks at the legacy that Edward Cullen is leaving behind and it's impact on female readers  
  
  
[Gossip Girl](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/13Rparent.html?pagewanted=1)  
Writer Michael Winerip discusses the "brand placement" in teenage girl series and asks how adults should respond to the consumeristic mentally in such series.  
  
Both are thought provoking and worth the read.
