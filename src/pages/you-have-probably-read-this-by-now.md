One of the best things in my life is that I have so many friends who consider Liz Lemon a kindred spirit.  Tina Fey has been one of my favorite people to watch over the past few years and her brand of feminism and brains is incredibly refreshing.  I can't believe that I never wrote about _Bossypants_ after I read it in May (though I counted and I have over 15  unpublished drafts on my blog).  Rather than write too much about it, I just wanted to say read it.  Everyone.  

  

Below is one of my favorite passages.  

  

"But I think the first real change in women’s body image came when JLo turned it butt-style. That was the first time that having a large-scale situation in the back was part of mainstream American beauty. Girls wanted butts now. Men were free to admit that they had always enjoyed them. And then, what felt like moments later, boom—Beyoncé brought the leg meat. A back porch and thick muscular legs were now widely admired. And from that day forward, women embraced their diversity and realized that all shapes and sizes are beautiful. Ah ha ha. No. I’m totally messing with you. All Beyonce and JLo have done is add to the laundry list of attributes women must have to qualify as beautiful. Now every girl is expected to have Caucasian blue eyes, full Spanish lips, a classic button nose, hairless Asian skin with a California tan, a Jamaican dance hall ass, long Swedish legs, small Japanese feet, the abs of a lesbian gym owner, the hips of a nine-year-old boy, the arms of Michelle Obama, and doll tits. The person closest to actually achieving this look is Kim Kardashian, who, as we know, was made by Russian scientists to sabotage our athletes."
