the day after  
the wind  
showers the sidewalk  
with my winter curses  
it snows.  
and somehow  
unplanned  
unexpected  
as the snow glitters down  
in front of brooklyn  
streetlights and storefronts and stoops  
i am reminded  
there's more in me  
than anger.  
and maybe  
some poetry remained  
after all.
