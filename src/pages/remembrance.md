"There isn't a story in the world that isn't in part, at least, addressed to the past," (299). I read [_Let the Great World Spin_](http://akindoflibrary.com/let-the-great-world-spin/) at a lonely time in my city life, missing friends who seemed to have all moved away within 6 months of each other.  Colum McCann's book reminded me to look for beauty and redemption, and I credit it with pulling me out of what felt like a long winter. I picked up his latest, _Transatlantic_, excited, but sadly for the first half of the book found myself bored with what felt like three mostly disparate short stories, (though connected to Ireland and America, which I loved): the first of two men who flew across the Atlantic in 1919, the second in the voice of Frederick Douglass and the time he spent in Ireland in 1845, and the third in the voice of George Mitchell, who helped write the peace accords in Ireland in 1998.  I wanted to dive into a story and get to know a character well, and these chapters felt like something I had to push myself through.  But then the book shifted half way through and McCann began to tell the story of four generations of women whose family had been affected by each of the events described in the first half of the book.  I began to see a beautiful lineage and purpose to what McCann was crafting.

Moving to the country (as western Long Island was called at the time) and buying the house from which he would never move.

What stories did he himself carry?" (285).  This was one of the hardest parts for me to read this morning, because I found myself thinking about all the stories my grandfather carried, some of which only came out as people came to the wake and the funeral and shared the ways my grandpa had helped take care of them in some way over the years: things he never even thought to tell us about simply because it was just the way he lived.  You do the right thing.  You give people chances. You offer a hand to your friends. And you definitely complain if a restaurant isn't up to your standards. Ha. Part of the story revolves around a letter that gets passed down through the generations and one of the characters remarks: "We seldom know what echo our actions will find, but our stories will most certainly outlast us," (295).  And this is exactly what I needed to read as I've grieved for a man so unique, humble, and fearless.  Immediately my mind drifted to the cool June evening after his funeral, with almost my entire family sitting in his small house together, laughing and crying, remembering the stories that bind us all together, the ones we love to retell and share.  This is intangible beauty--and what will outlast my grandpa's physical presence.

I don't write this to publicly grieve, but to simply say: may you have stories that bind your heart when it feels most fragile.  May you come across the written word in transforming ways. And, may the road rise to meet you.
