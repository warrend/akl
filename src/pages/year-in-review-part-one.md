My top ten reading experiences of 2009:  
  
1\. The [Shock Doctrine](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2009/09/shock-doctrine-context-for-my-brain-of.html) by [Naomi Klein](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2009/09/shock-doctrine-and-english-majors-never.html).  Hands down the most thought provoking book (fiction or nonfiction) of the year.  
  
2\. [Anna Karenina](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2009/03/love-and-duty-passion-and-indifference.html) by Leo Tolstoy. The first of the Russians that my book club read. Love.  
  
3. [The Elegance of the Hedgehog](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2009/06/kindred-souls.html) by Muriel Barbery. There really aren't words for how much I loved this book. Favorite fiction read of the year.  
  
4. [The Year of Magical Thinking](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2009/02/magical-thinking.html) by Joan Didion.  One of the most beautiful, honest memoirs I've ever read.  
  
5. [The Invention of Hugo Cabret](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2009/03/best-kinds-of-books.html) by Brian Selznick. Children's Lit combined with gorgeous, gorgeous pencil drawing illustrations. So enjoyable.  
  
6. [Compassion](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2009/11/advent-compassion-or-and-they-will-call.html) by Henri Nouwen. Most influential book in my thought life. How I want to live.  
  

7. [The Savage Detectives](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2009/08/poetry-is-metaphor.html) by Roberto Bolano.  Bolano fascinates me (his _Amulet_ made [last year's list](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2008/12/year-in-review-part-one.html)).  

  

8. [The Brothers Karamazo](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2009/06/brothers-karamazov-existential-dilemmas.html)v by Fyodor Dostoevsky. Long, but so worth it, especially when reading with a book club.  

  

9\. [Anne of Green Gables](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2009/10/anne-shirley-youre-my-hero.html) by L.M. Montgomery.  Because rereading this book never gets old.  
  
10. [The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2009/06/god-save-queen.html) by Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows. Not so much for its literary value, but for the perfect morning of escapism I had in Central Park this summer.
