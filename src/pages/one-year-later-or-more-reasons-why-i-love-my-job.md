One of the post labels on this blog is "[why](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2012/02/defining-love-in-8th-grade-english.html) [8th graders](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2011/05/to-my-students-with-respect-this.html) [aren't](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2008/12/wonder.html) [jaded](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2010/11/on-harry-potter-and-another-reason-why.html)." So many people have negative conceptions of middle school age students and teenagers in general, but part of my job as a teacher and a person, I believe, is to counter that claim.  I love when former students stop by to tell me about their lives beyond 8th grade.  These two are no exception.  For both 7th and 8th grade, they amazed me with their writing pieces and reading lives and the life they brought into my classroom.  Somehow I was able to take this picture in between an afternoon of non-stop laughing on the last day of school last June, before they left my classroom after two years for different, impressive high schools in Manhattan.

They came to visit me yesterday and somehow we managed, albeit with some difficulty, to recreate the shot a year later.  It was incredible to hear about where life has taken them in the past year and the plans on their horizons--writing, traveling, reading, learning, playing sports and of course laughing.  These pictures crack me up because of their assumed seriousness is the opposite of their personalities.

All that to say, I am so proud of the people they--and my other visitors--are becoming.  It makes me love my job so much.
