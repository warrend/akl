on the fourth floor  
i live  
on a hill  
my old bay windows  
are good for watching  
weather sweep and change.

across the street  
my neighbors stand  
on a roof  
i wish i had a roof  
to see the lighting over the bay  
but i have my screenless window  
wide wide open.  
a bird might fly in.  
but i love the air  
and the early sunset light behind the clouds  
and the the lightning that almost blends in  
i'm wondering if the rain will follow?  
the clouds are creeping, leaving  
eveninglight behind.

i was hanging out the window  
when the sky decided to speak  
the clouds had moved so fast  
that half the sky was ominous, half at rest.  
drops assailed the sidewalk  
and the smell of asphalt city summer steam  
met me at my window.
