This year was the first year that I actually numbered the reading experiences. Each is linked to the original blog post (or two).  Enjoy.  
  
10\. [_The Shadow of the Wind_](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2010/05/on-finding-kindred-books-and-getting.html) by Carlos Ruiz Zafon. It's a mystery about (life and) books. It's set in Barcelona. What is not to love?  
  
9. [_The Time Traveler's Wife_](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2010/04/story-about-time-and-unapologetically.html) by Audrey Niffenegger.  I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this book. I thought it would be a little too sappy or not well written, but I was very pleasantly surprised.  
  
8\. [_Suite Francaise_](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2010/07/suite-francaise-and-suffering.html) by [Irene Nemiresky](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2010/07/bound-together-as-humans.html).  I love historical fiction and Nemiresky's personal story as connected to this unfinished piece about Germany's occupation in France was fascinating.  
  
7\. [_American Pastoral_](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2010/07/illusion-mess-american-pastoral.html) by Philip Roth. I wasn't sure how I escaped Roth.  This dark story went along brilliantly with a lot of the cultural portraits and critiques I've read or seen recently.  
  
6\. _March_ by Geraldine Brooks: how I got away with not writing about this book, I have no idea.  This short book followed the father's story from Little Women, but had plenty to say about both men and women. Post to follow soon!  
  
5\. [_The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo_ Trilogy](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2010/08/fiction-as-eye-opener.html) by Steig Larsson: I jumped on the bandwagon and got sucked in.  These are incredibly smart and addictive mysteries (technically I'm finishing the third one in the final days of 2010...100 pages in as of now).  
  
 4. [_The Lacuna_](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2010/02/missing-piece.html) by [Barbara Kingsolver](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2010/02/on-way-to-becoming-people-of-weight.html): _The Poisonwood Bible_ was one of the most thought provoking books I've ever read.  My book club decided to read this as soon as it came out and it was a gorgeous blend of storytelling and history.  
  

3\. [_Let the Great World Spin_](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2010/06/let-great-world-spin.html) by [Colum McCann](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2010/05/3-books-1-train-of-thought.html): this book was phenomenal. Go buy it now. 

  

2\. [_Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2010/10/harry-potter-is-just-too-big-for-blog.html) by [J.K. Rowling](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2010/11/on-harry-potter-and-another-reason-why.html) reread with students: Harry Potter 7 made my top ten list back in [2008](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2007/12/year-in-review-top-ten-books.html), but this fall's rereading experience with my students was a-maz-ing. So much passion. So much intellect.  
  
1\. [_Great House_](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2010/11/in-small-and-ordinary.html) by Nicole Krauss: History of Love, Krauss' second novel, made the top ten in 2008 right along with HP. I could not wait for this book to be released and had its date on my refrigerator months in advance.  This book is beautiful, haunting and thought provoking.
