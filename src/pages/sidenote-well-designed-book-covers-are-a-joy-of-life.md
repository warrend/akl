For some reason, blogger won't let me post pictures anymore, so you'll have to go to [this link](http://www.penguin.co.uk/static/cs/uk/0/minisites/greatideas/index_1.html) and look at Penguin's Great Ideas series: I love the design for all four series and think I may start collecting them.  
  
Also. Puffin [relaunched children's classics](http://www.puffin.co.uk/nf/Search/QuickSearchProc/1,,,00.html?strSearch=&homeNav=Y&textSearch=&travel=&advSearchStr=&adv=0&searchProfile=UK-618838-global&path=c618838-00000000%23%23-1%23%23-1~~f26%7C%7C372d39~~f10%7C%7C50756666696e20436c61737369637320323030382052656c61756e6368~~nf6%7C%7C50756666696e20436c6173736963) with gorgeous covers and they are only $5!
