Somehow September started and I barely noticed.  Then I found myself in my classroom at school trying to set up my library before the kiddos arrived and I realized summer was indeed over. Interestingly enough, [last summer's reading conclusion](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2009/08/last-day-of-august-summer-reading.html) was written on a 65 degree August day. Today, the high is 94 degrees and I've got a hurricane looming over my labor day weekend flight to the homeland.   
  
The biggest clue to summer ending for me is that I find myself needing/wanting to read 5 books at once.  It is a habit I typically grow out of during my season of freedom because I am able to spend so much time reading, that I finish books pretty quickly.  Here's how it went this year:  
  
I read _almost_ all of the books on [my list](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2010/06/summer-reading-final-list.html)! I think this is due in part to the fact that I was traveling, which forced me to plan. These included:  
  
_Suite Francaise_ by Irene Nemirevsky  
_In the Woods_ by Tana French  
_The Girl Who Played With Fire_ by Steig Larrson  
_March_ by Geraldine Brooks  
_Stuart Little_ by E.B. White (children's)  
_Freak the Mighty_ by Rodman Philbrick (young adult)  
_The Giver_ by Lois Lowry (young adult)  
_A Wrinkle in Time_ by Madeleine L'Engle (young adult)  
  
I picked up a few along the way, borrowed from a friend and my mom (and two I broke down and bought):  
  
_American Pastoral_ by Philip Roth  
_The Art of Racing in the Rain_ by Garth Stein  
_Chasing Fireflies_ by Charles Martin  
_The Summer Book_ by Tove Jansson  
_The Curse of the Good Girl_ by Rachel Simmons  
_Slouching Towards Bethlehem_ by Joan Didion  
_The Absolutely True Diary of a Part Time Indian_ by Alexie Sherman (young adult)  
  
Final conclusions: Favorites: _March_ and rereading _The Summer Book_. Also, despite (almost) always having a book on hand, I found myself missing my bookshelves and some randoms I wanted to reread on lazy days at home (Harry Potter, especially).  Also, my books weighed too much and took up too much space in my carry on.  It was the only time I have ever wanted an e-reader of some sort.  Scary. Anyway, cheers to the fall and the craziness that my reading life is sure to become (which is the subject of my next post!)
