Even though school doesn't get out until late June, I always plan to start my summer reading June 1: Celebrate Brooklyn is getting set up at Prospect Park, it's almost time for 8th grade prom, I have days on the calendar to visit the ocean, last night my friend grilled food and we had rose on her stoop. Summer is arriving, if only figuratively for now.

This is the only time of year I really map out my reading life--I'm not sure if it's because I remember the summer reading stamps at the library growing up and subconsciously like to watch my progress, or if it's my teaching brain wanting to chart out a course of study for myself. Regardless, I love curating a summer list from the ever-growing list on my phone and diving into these books in my season of revitalization.

Happiest of summer reading to you.

(Note: I tried to include links to the books--a few were limited to amazon. I would strongly recommend checking out your local bookstore or library over amazon, if you are able. The people there are champions of print, publishing, and passion. If you're in NYC, I love and frequent: [Community Bookstore](http://communitybookstore.net/), [Greenlight Bookstore](http://www.greenlightbookstore.com/), [BookCourt](http://bookcourt.com/), [McNally Jackson](http://mcnallyjackson.com/), [Strand](http://www.strandbooks.com/), [Book Culture](http://www.bookculture.com/), [PowerHouse Arena](http://www.powerhousearena.com/), [Three Lives Books](http://www.threelives.com/).

Also, [lists](http://akindoflibrary.com/category/summer-reading-conclusion/) from summers past.)

**Nonfiction**: In a year that has felt really stressful, I've surprisingly gravitated toward more nonfiction books, most have been essay collections and memoirs by people who live intentionally and grapple with meaning.

[Last Things](http://www.amazon.com/Things-Vintage-Contemporaries-Jenny-Offill/dp/1101872071) by Jenny Offill (I recently read the beautiful, sad, incredibly crafted [Department of Speculation](http://www.npr.org/2014/01/26/265674275/in-fragments-of-a-marriage-familiar-themes-get-experimental) and wanted to explore more books by this author)

Go Set a Watchman by Harper Lee (I think my book club, which is filled with the most passionate readers I know, half of whom have/are work in publishing, is going to read this together. We are grappling with all the [feelings](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/go-set-a-watchman-is-the-prospect-of-another-book-from-harper-lee-a-potshot-at-the-mockingbird-or-a-literary-coup-10031359.html) related to its release)

**Teaching Books**: 11 years almost complete and I'm still learning so much about how to be a reading teacher. And, even though it's summer, I get pretty psyched about learning and dreaming about crafting a stronger classroom.

[Understanding Dyslexia and Other Learning Disabilites](http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Dyslexia-Other-Learning-Disabilities/dp/1926966295) by Linda Siegel: recommended highly by one of my professors this semester who taught me so much about reading acquisition. She claims it reads like a novel and could be a beach read. Whether that's true or not, I'm looking forward to having better answers for parents and students.

[Notice and Note](http://www.heinemann.com/products/E04693.aspx) by Kylene Beers: I heard the author speak a few summers ago and was so moved by her love of authentic, engaging reading for middle and high school students. I'm looking to build my knowledge of ways to get kids make meaning from the books they've chosen
