March, oh March,  
season of seasons  
why art thou so elusive?  
  
thy bringeth me light  
and the movement of clocks  
thy bringeth me spring  
the rebirth of my heart  
  
i can not comprehend why this morning  
when i woke  
white flakes coming down  
oh heaven, i choke  
  
on the bear hug of winter  
that has gone on too long  
please don't play with my heart  
to me it's no joke  
  
the poor youth that i teach  
are being affected  
because my longing for sun and warmth  
is being rejected.  
  
but i can only hang my head  
as i look out my window upon the gray  
PLEASE, I beg  
NO WINTER COAT TODAY.  
  
But the old ankle length down  
hangs in my closet mocking my frown.
