blooming, announcing  
remind me of home  
the one I can't return to  
Atchison Road  
where spring was an artisan;  
lending its hand  
to suburban midwest.  
Atchison Road  
where I didn't try to carry  
the world on my back  
because I didn't know  
much  
beyond my yard my woods my neighbors  
  
And sometimes  
on cloudy spring days in the city  
the colors seem to  
pop  
and my heart is grateful for this town--  
how beauty is different and deep here.  
and yet I long  
for my house upon a little hill  
and the times when i could always  
breathe  
deeply.
