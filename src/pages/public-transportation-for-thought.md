A man is talking to ghosts  
with intensity  
and dancing without steps to music we can't hear  
or maybe he's just stomping  
maybe its fear  
mine or ours and his  
because as the stations pass through the windows  
he's still talking  
but we're not listening  
just creeping  
nonchalantly toward the end of the car  
just looking  
uncomfortably at the space  
we  
have  
created  
between us and the song  
we don't understand.  
  
Unthinking  
I walk out  
resolutely  
quite clear of those damn closing doors  
unaware  
my heavy steps hit the metal stairs  
until i'm facing off with the williamsburg bank tower--  
both of us  
glaring through the cold,  
marking a space,  
stung.  
back in the world  
I don't understand.
