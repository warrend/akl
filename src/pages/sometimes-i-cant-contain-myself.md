Sunday mornings when it's almost 60 are some of those times. I confess that I have been looking forward to this day ever since it appeared in the ten day forecast. I took a walk around my neighborhood, decided that the Tea Lounge was way too dark and not fitting for such a glorious morning, so I ordered my delicious (seriously the best in town) Cafe Au Lait to go and have parked myself in the bay windows in my own apartment. I opened the window. My writer's notebook and Staedtler pens are next to me. Bursting! And I need to document this, albeit not very poetic, to remember \*hope\* and spring when the temperature drops again.  
  
Sigh. Currently playing (basically all of the kindred travelling songs...):  
  
The Beautiful Sea.  
  
Son of a Son of a Sailor.  
  
For the Widows in Paradise, for the Fatherless in Ypsilanti.  
  
Liz on Top of the World.  
  
Why Should I Cry for You.  
  
  
Ok. Off to write some fiction.
