I write about it [every year](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/search/label/summer%20reading%20conclusion), but never have I been more grateful for the rhythm of summer to work its wonders in my overwhelmed teacher brain.  This year in particular I was able to be re-inspired and energized professionally by the Teachers College Reading and Writing Institutes in July, take a few weeks to read, breathe and finalize details for my wedding, then celebrate getting to spend the rest of my life with the best guy I'll ever know with my favorite people in the world.  We were able to escape and soak in the Cinque Terre, Florence, and Barcelona.  And suddenly I found myself excited to be thinking about September, my new students, and who we will all be as readers and writers.   Here's the text journey that got me to this place. I [posted](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2013/06/summer-reading-list-notes.html) in mid June about my plans, which included curling up with some nonfiction, but that never happened.  I think in the summer, especially, I just want to get lost in a good story.  I've starred the ones that I'd most highly recommend.  
  
I call these books the "I commuted for over two hours every day" collection from late June/early July.  You can also tell by the fact that I blogged extensively in my early summer days that I was ready to really think about what I was reading.

These books are the "I need a vacation and only want to read mysteries" collection from August.  You can tell by the lack of blog posts about these books that I was either on vacation or starting to plan curriculum, so I haven't written about these yet. The first three I read on my Kindle--as a e-book newbie.

_The Stone Cutter_ by Camilla Lackburg  
_The Cuckoo's Calling_ by Robert Galbraith (J.K. Rowling)  
_Where'd You Go Bernadette?_ by Maria Semple  
  
Young Adult:

_I am J_ by Cris Beam  
_Playground_ by 50 Cent  
_Nothing to Fear_ by Jackie French Koller  
  
On my parents' porch, as always, I read _The Summer Book_ by Tove Jansson.  However, I didn't write about it this year because this was in the three days before my wedding. I did post about it on instagram, though! A picture is a text, too, you know:)  
  
Happy September.  Enjoy the new starts, the school supplies, the football, the pumpkin spice.  Sigh.
