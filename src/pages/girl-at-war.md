Girl at War is alternately narrated by a girl in wartime Croatia in the 90s, and the same girl as a college junior in New York City in the early 2000s. One of the struggles she faces is that there are very few people who understand or even know of all her country experienced. One of my favorite things about literature is that it is able to bring to life places I know little about--and my hope is that as I gain some context for a time and place, understand the narratives of others, and to step outside of my own life.
