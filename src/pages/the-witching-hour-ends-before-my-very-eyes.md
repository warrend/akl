the stone of the steeple  
is brighter somehow at dusk  
when I can barely see the sun;  
just the colors it leaves behind  
across a darkening blue  
sky  
and the trees  
they are suddenly full  
disoriented leaves  
lurching  
one way and the next  
and the backdrop from this 4th floor window  
seems like a canvas-  
and when I take a moment to look up  
it all just catches-  
but it's not white,  
somehow more brilliant  
as the clock moves closer and closer to nine  
and the sun has passed  
and its message  
is no longer  
visible.  
it sounds like a storm is coming?
