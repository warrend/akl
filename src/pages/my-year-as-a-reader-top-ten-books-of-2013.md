I generally count my time in alignment school years: September is the new year and August is the month of reflection and generating new ideas for the coming year, so it's always interesting each December to examine and reflect on the calendar year.  And actually, it's probably healthier to not count my days by my profession.  This year was one of my favorites: First and foremost, I got engaged on January 1st and our wedding in August was a celebration with family and friends I will truly never forget (especially my grandpa organizing the Yager family at the hotel bar Friday night, dancing to Gloria with my Uncle Bob at the reception, or my Brooklyn girls fulfilling their promise of charging to the dance floor as soon as the music started, hands in the air).

Personally, I have learned so much about paying attention to small moments of beauty and truth, breathing deeply, and taking the time to nurture creativity.  Professionally, this summer I had the opportunity to be inspired by kindred educators at the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project's institutes, which has driven so much of the energizing work happening right now in my classroom and my ability to truly celebrate each of my students and their voices. As a reader, I set a [resolution](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2012/12/new-years-reading-resolution.html) at the end of last year to not buy any new books until I made it through the ones I already owned.  I did pretty well on that until the spring and it completely fell apart once June hit and I decided that summer reading was an exception.  Oops.  But, I did buy a kindle and used the kindle app on my ipad to read multiple book, and learned about how to check out e-books from the library.  Also, I'm such a fan of independent book stores, that it was hard to walk in and NOT buy something, just to show solidarity in their mission, especially [Greenlight](http://greenlightbookstore.com/), [Community Bookstore](http://communitybookstore.net/), and [Book Court](http://bookcourt.com/). Regardless of how I got them, though, below are the ten best books that narrated my whole path this year: [Cloud Atlas](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2013/01/cloud-atlas-if-anything-can-save-us-its.html) by David Mitchell: This was story tucked into story tucked into story, told in a mirror image format that was the most challenging and most thought provoking fiction of the year. I couldn't stop thinking about the thread that tied the narratives together. [Quiet](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2013/01/introversion-not-bad-word-or.html) by Susan Cain: The subtitle really says it all for this one--_the power of introverts in a world that can't stop talking_.  This was the best nonfiction book I read all year and help me to not just own my introverted nature, but think about how I can empower my introverted students. [The Ocean at the End of the Lane](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2013/07/neil-gaimans-ocean-at-end-of-lane.html) by Neil Gaiman: This short book is for adults who have forgotten the magic of being a child. At once fantastical and realistic, this story was phenomenal and my favorite fiction book of the year. [A Monster Calls](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2013/07/a-monster-calls-book-about-healing-from.html) by Patrick Ness: My cousin and her son recommended this middle grade book to me and I think it is one of the most important I've ever read about life and loss.  I wept at the end, which is rare for me, and had a hard time recovering--but this is because it beautifully captured so much of what it means to be human.  The illustrations were breathtaking, as well. [The Illusion of Separateness](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2013/07/poetic-connection-illusion-of.html) by Simon Van Booy: Van Booy has become one of my favorite authors because of his poetic style and ability to capture tiny moments of humanity at its most beautiful.  As suggested by the title, it follows multiple story lines to show how people are much more connected to one another than we realize. Life after Life by Kate Atkinson: I read mostly mystery for the month of August and this was my favorite by far.  Atkinson's protagonist is born in 1910 and the story continually resets itself and re-imagines what her life may have looked like. [Wave](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2013/10/literature-and-loss-wave.html) by Sonali Deraniyagala: This memoir is one of the most discussed books of the year and Deraniyagala's story of grief after losing her husband, sons, and parents in the 2004 tsunami is heart-wrenching, powerful, brave, and important. [Everyday](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2013/12/the-gift-of-solitude-applicable-to-all.html) by David Levithan: This book was by far my favorite Young Adult read of the year.  The protagonist is, essentially, a soul--s/he inhabits a different body each day and the reader gets to experience this unique voice and watch as s/he tries to craft a life outside the inhabitation s/he cannot control. [The Gifts of Imperfection](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2013/11/brene-brown-game-changer.html) by Brene Brown: By far the most transformative nonfiction/personal growth book of the year, especially for this Type A/Oldest Child combination.  She helped me find some grounding and do a lot of the thinking work that propelled me from May onward through the year. [1,000 Mornings](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2013/12/the-magic-of-paying-attention-mary.html) by Mary Oliver: This short book of (accessible!) poetry grounded me as the seasons changed and helped put some of the wisdom I took from Brene Brown to work.
