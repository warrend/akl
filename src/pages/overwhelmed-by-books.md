September is my new years.  I've never left the school year calendar, so I am lucky enough to still relish in new pencils and notebooks and post-its each fall.  My summer days are pretty leisurely, but there is something in my persona that is absolutely ready to start using my tiny moleskin planner again.  I also leave behind my nice, neat world of summer reading and end up with massive stacks of books to read and the desire to read them all at once.  It is September where I usually start reading a few books at once, given that they are different genres.  
  
These are my current genres and a few titles of what you might be seeing posted around here in the near future:  
  
Young adult for school. I'm doing book clubs with my students all year, so I'll be in a young adult book at all times. We are starting with _Sold_ by Patricia McCormick and in a month or two we are doing a "I read _Harry Potter_ #7 way to fast" reread club!  
  
Young adult for research. I've been trying to study books with female protagonists.  I'm going to revisit some favorites like Nancy Drew and _Dicey's Song_.  
  
Fiction for book clubs and/or my sanity. Upcoming picks: _March_ by Geraldine Brooks and _A Short History of Women_ by Kate Walbert.  
  
Nonfiction for research, to add to the female protagonist study: _Shelf Discovery: Teen Classics We Never Stopped Reading_ and _Everything I Needed to Know About Being a Girl I Learned From Judy Blume_.  
  
Nonfiction to learn. _Surprised by Hope_ by N.T. Wright. _No Logo_ by Naomi Klein.  
  
There is a good chance I'll be reading one of each at any given moment and I couldn't be more excited to get started.  There are just so many words to read! Cheers to the feeling of fall and the beginnings of great things (and the most glorious season of life)!
