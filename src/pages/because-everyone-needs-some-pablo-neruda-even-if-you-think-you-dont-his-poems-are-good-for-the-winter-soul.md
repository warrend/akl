Here, There, Everywhere by Pablo Neruda  
_(Senor Neruda, un dia voy poder leer tu poesia en espanol._   
                                      _Mucho amor, Kristen)_   
  
Now the earth is spinning round me,  
dizzying me,  
like metal at the sound of bells.  
  
Now I have all I have loved  
within my little universe,  
the starred order of wavs,  
the sudden disorder of stones.  
Far off, a city in rags  
calling me, poor siren,  
so that my heart can never, no,  
scorn its weight of obligation,  
and I with sky and poems  
in the light of all I love,  
poised here, swithering,  
raising the cup of my song.  
  
Oh dawn, breaking out of  
the shadow and the moon in the sea,  
I always come back to your burning salt.  
It is your solitude always which moves me  
and, back once more, I don't know who I am.  
I touch the hard sand, I look at the sky,  
I walk without knowing where I'm going  
until out of the night  
indescribable flowers rise and fall;  
in the salty air  
of the coast the stars quiver.  
  
Wandering love, I come back  
with this heart both fresh and wearied,  
belonging to water and sand,  
to the dry spaces of the foreshore,  
to the white war of the foam.
