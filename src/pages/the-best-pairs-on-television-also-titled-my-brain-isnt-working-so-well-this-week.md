My weekends lately have been spent watching a ridiculous amount of television, hence a post about it instead of a book. I blame the weather and also stress. But I have come to a new conclusion...I have a new favorite couple on tv that beats out past favorites, which include:

Ross and Rachel

Felicity and Ben (not. Noel.)

Carrie and Aidan (so they broke up, whatever)

the frustrating tale of Jack and Kate

Tobias and Lindsay...there's actually no picture of the two of them alone that I can find. ha.

But I have to say that my favorite new pair on television is Brennan and Booth from "Bones." They are completely opposite and yet completely compatible and they are not officially together. But I think that their relationship is made up of some of the most creative writing I've seen on TV. And this is how I've been wasting my time while it's too cold to be outside. I highly recommend...and if I can handle the gore of their cases, so can you.
