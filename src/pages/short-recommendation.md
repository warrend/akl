I have no idea how I haven't posted about Sloane Crosley after reading her first book of essays, _I Was Told There'd Be Cake_ a few years ago. But since I made a hard cover purchase the day her second book was released (I can count all previous hard cover purchases on one hand...and I buy a lot of books), I realized it's high time that I publicly recommend her highly amusing essays to the 5 people who read this blog. Â Crosley's essays resonate with me as she grew up in the suburbs, moved to New York and is about my age, but I remain convinced that they are pretty funny for almost anyone.  
  
Anyway, nothing too deep, but if you are looking for an entertaining summer read, either of these two would work.
