I couldn't sit here and be ok with myself leaving you with winter poetry (see below). Here's one from Pablo Neruda. sigh.  
  
Stop cursing the cold and breathe this in and think about summertimeeveninglight--yes, that's one word. My picture is of summertimeeveninglight in Hardington, England. Enchanted is the most perfect word for this. And an overflowing glass a water? There isn't a more accurate description. So read at your own risk, I guess. It just might affect you that much. Especially if you are living in the April freeze like I am. And for those of you who lived through the last round of cicadas, just imagine he's talking about crickets.  
  
Ode To Enchanted Light  
  
Under the trees light  
has dropped from the top of the sky,  
light  
like a green  
latticework of branches,  
shining  
on every leaf,  
drifting down like clean  
white sand.  
  
A cicada sends  
its sawing song  
high into the empty air.  
  
The world is  
a glass overflowing  
with water.
