Despite the fact that school is still in session here in New York City until June 28th (the summer solstice arrives a week _before_ we get out), I've decided to go ahead and post my summer reading list. I have an ongoing list on my phone of books I want to read--sometimes they come from magazine articles or friends' recommendations, and but most often they are a result of my compulsive bookstore browsing. I check in with it often, but every summer I nerd out and create a syllabus for myself and really try to dig into books from the list. For the past few years, I've chosen some nonfiction books that I designate as my "morning and weekend reads"--books that get me thinking about life and guide how I want to go about living. **Nonfiction**: [_The Great Spring_](http://nataliegoldberg.com/books/the-great-spring/) by Natalie Goldberg, [_The Abundance_](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/books/review/the-abundance-by-annie-dillard.html?_r=0) by Annie Dillard, [_A Field Guide to Getting Lost_](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/08/04/field-guide-to-getting-lost-rebecca-solnit/) by Rebecca Solnit Then I'll be sure to intentionally tuck in a few mystery novels--because what is better in the summertime? **Mystery**: [_Sharp Objects_](http://gillian-flynn.com/sharp-objects/) by Gillian Flynn, [_Ordinary Grace_](http://www.williamkentkrueger.com/ordinarygrace.html) by  William Kent Krueger, *[Luckiest Girl Alive](http://www.lennyletter.com/life/a316/what-i-know/)* by Jenny Knoll The rest is made up of fiction, with a "fingers-crossed I finish these quickly" mindset so I can add a  couple more in. **Fiction**: [_Behind the Scenes at the Museum_](http://www.kateatkinson.co.uk/book_detail.php?b=Behind_the_Scenes_at_the_Museum) by Kate Atkinson, [_Imagine Me Gone_](http://www.adamhaslett.net/imagine-me-gone/) by Adam Haslett, [_Among the Ten Thousand Things_](http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/228436/among-the-ten-thousand-things-by-julia-pierpont/9780812985344/) by Julia Pierpont, [_The Reluctant Fundamentalist_](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/22/books/review/Olsson.t.html) by Mohsin Hamid, _[Outline](http://www.npr.org/2015/01/13/376093557/theres-nothing-sketchy-about-this-outline)_ by Rachel Cusk [**Rereads**](http://akindoflibrary.com/decades-worth-rereading-favorites-blogs-tenth-year/): _The Waves_ by Virginia Woolf, _Great House_ by Nicole Krauss And, obviously, [_Harry Potter and the Cursed Child_](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/10/new-harry-potter-cursed-child-eighth-book-july-play-script). How I wish I had tickets to see it in London! (If you are looking for recommendations of books I've already read, check out previous [summer reading conclusions](http://akindoflibrary.com/category/summer-reading-conclusion/) or my [years in review](http://akindoflibrary.com/category/year-in-review/).) I wish you a delightful summer of reading, hopefully by the ocean, a lake, a pool, a park, or if one must as I do, your fire escape :)
