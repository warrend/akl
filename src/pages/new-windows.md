Maybe it's autumn. Maybe it's Brooklyn. Let me back up.  
  
Last January, my first post on this blog was about how I wanted to write about the books I was reading and how they caused me to look differently at the world around me. Since the summer, I have been on an unofficial blogging hiatus (and let me just say that I love that I can use the verb "to blog" in my life. ha.) Somewhere in between relocating to Brooklyn, friends leaving the city and teaching a new curriculum, my writing has waned. In the midst of life changes, I feel it is easier to be busy than to sit and think. But that's no way to live. So.  
  
I kind of need to reinvent my blog--mostly because I'm feeling this creative pull in more ways than reading and writing. Perhaps part of me is being reinvented. It's still a library...but just as in the Borges quote, it's a \*kind\* of library that may now be responding more to the life that my senses imprint on my mind. We'll see where it takes me.  
  
Here are some views from the literal new windows. I look like a fool with my camera out the window of my fourth floor apartment, but the light is so lovely I can't help myself.
