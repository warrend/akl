watch the summer storm from your window--  
and gape at how diagonal the rain can be  
especially since the sun is still out.  
while you are remembering how hail forms  
decide to not go into the city  
and instead go to the park  
when the rain is gone but the sinking sun remains.  
walk and walk and walk  
and listen  
to your brooding music  
and watch  
the children walking on the stone wall  
just the way you would've wanted to  
if you were eight.  
it's a good idea to stop at the litchfield villa  
and linger for a little while with the flowers in front  
maybe pretending you're in England--  
if you're anything like me.  
and maybe just stop  
and stare into the woods,  
leaning on the same stone wall you might want to walk on  
and wait to see if it's firefly season yet.  
remember a little bit  
and imagine that the woods were deep.  
smile as you're walking home and see  
a little lightning bug  
who decided to share the sidewalk with you.  
yes. that's about all.
