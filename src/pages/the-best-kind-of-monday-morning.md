sometimes  
when i hear the rain  
on the fire escape  
and on the roof  
i am glad.  
for my fourth floor walk up  
and the layers of down  
that i am curled beneath.  
for early early morning quiet  
(except for that rain out the windows)  
and eyes  
not quite asleep.  
but quite aware.  
that  
stillness  
is  
perfect.
