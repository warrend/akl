I finally bought it a couple weeks ago--around the time it shot to the top of the best sellers in light of the president saying that John Lewis was a man of all talk and no action. The trilogy is Congress Representative John Lewis's memoir of his work in the Civil Rights era, told in flashback as he attends Barak Obama's inauguration. It tells not only his personal story, but the story of the movement and a lot of the nuances that aren't a part of the simplified Civil Rights era with which most of us are familiar. There are scenes of brutality that even when told through small pictures took my breath away and I had to pause to grapple with our country's history. I appreciated the inclusion of many famous speeches by leaders of the movement, politicians, and the people working against civil rights--it helped me understand the tensions and nuances of the era.

It was a scene with Robert F Kennedy where he tells John Lewis: "You, the young people of SNCC \[Lewis's organization\], have educated me. You have changed me. Now I understand." Lewis goes on to narrate: "It showed me something about Robert Kennedy that I came to respect: even though he could be a little rough--ruthless, some would say--he was willing to learn, to grow, and to change," (Book 2, page 152)   It felt like this was a calling out--and I've been thinking a lot lately about one's capacity to change--about my capacity to change, and about the times where I can look and see shifts in my own thinking. I never want to stop learning and I never want to stop reflecting: who am I? Who do I want to be? What is influencing who I am becoming? I want to ask myself these questions often and not be afraid to broaden my perspective, to grow as a human, to change--and I would encourage everyone to ask the same questions. This series is a must-read. Period. I am so grateful to MyLibraryNYC who provided 9 copies of the series to share with my students--graphic novels are expensive to get into my classroom library and their teacher set has been making quite the circulation among my classes. Seeing students eager to learn about history, talk about history, talk about change and justice is the main thing that is keeping me sane these days.
