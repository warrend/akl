I washed my hair  
with the same travel size shampoo I haven't used since England  
a surprise--  
my senses highjacked  
because I haven't been breathing  
all that deep  
these months.  
Aching,  
I wanted  
to be  
all at sea,  
and realized it wasn't just there  
but northern Virginia's pines  
and the creek in my hometown  
and the roads that lead to Oxford  
and their cool pockets of air between trees  
that i just can't seem to find right now  
even though i keep looking  
My perceptions, maybe, are playing tricks on me.
