2015 started with a Buckeye National Championship, and I've got to say-- thinking back to those wins still brings me an insane amount of joy. It ended with me finishing the final 2 courses I need for my Literacy Specialist masters degree, which has been three years of a 3-train, hour-plus commute up to Teachers College for each class. Needless to say, I'm looking forward to the concept of "free time" in 2016--which I'm hoping to spend mainly pursuing painting, drawing, and photography. I just received Elizabeth Gilbert's *Big Magic* which I hope will help me to remember to not be afraid of not being good right off the bat. So much of my reading from this year, especially from [this](http://akindoflibrary.com/the-july-of-nonfiction-and-fire-escape-porches/) [summer](http://akindoflibrary.com/feeling-alive-or-thank-you-gwen-frostic-and-mary-oliver-yet-again/), helped cast a vision of what I want this year to be about--[making meaning](http://akindoflibrary.com/wild/) from the world around me and creating in response to it. Highlights from this year include the beginning of my book club, a trip to Austin with my best friends, finding nature in urbanity, another great weekend in the city with my mom, teaching with the best in the business, chasing after flowers in Louisville with my dad, wandering the city with Daniel, adventures with kindreds, my first Buckeye game, laughing with family in Kentucky, Ohio, NYC, and Newport, and playing with my nieces.
