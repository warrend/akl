"In reality, every reader, while he is reading, is the reader of his own self.  The writers work is merely a kind of optical instrument, which he offers to the reader to permit him to discern what, without the book, he would perhaps never have seen in himself.  The reader's recognition in his own self of what the book says is the proof of its truth." -Marcel Proust, Le temps retrouve (discovered via _A Tale for the Time Being_ by Ruth Ozeki) Most good things have been said far too many times and just need to be lived.  -Shane Claiborne Also, I designed a pretty fascinating bracelet, where you put a rubber band around your favorite book of poems for a year, and then you take it off and wear it. -Oskar Schell in _Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close_ I'll shake the sky like a hundred violins. -Esperanza in _The House on Mango Street_ Comparison is the thief of joy. -Teddy Roosevelt The thing that is really hard, and really amazing, is giving up on being perfect and beginning the work of becoming yourself. -Anna Quindlen
