This city I love  
and also hate  
where I can buy frogs in a bucket  
on Mott Street.  
Or stare down Elizabeth  
straight to the Empire  
surprisingly  
graceful at night  
Or drink a glass of Malbec  
next to exposed brick  
across from a good friend.  
This city I love  
and also hate  
became home  
somewhere between the Hudson River  
and tears at Communion  
and riding the D over the East  
unable to read.  
Just listening  
as I travel.  
Through this city.  
Writing  
on a crumpled receipt.
