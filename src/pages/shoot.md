Driving on the kind of night  
where you think you see  
a harvest moon  
sitting on the horizon  
reigning orange immense  
needing  
to stay within its gaze.  
But as you draw closer  
you laugh in the irony.  
It is nothing  
more  
than an illuminated  
Shell Gas Station sign,  
and you vow  
to get your eyes  
rechecked.
