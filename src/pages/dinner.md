On the surface level, the question raised throughout the book is: to what length should parents go to protect their children and at what age do children become responsible for their own actions?  On a deeper level, it is a novel of a man with little empathy grappling with his own psychological struggles that he is now forced to see in his son.  As he travels back through memory, the reader is sucked into his worldview and as we hear events from Paul's perspective it is easy to align with his thinking.  At first.  And so perhaps it's a book about the ability to become a victim of manipulation or good storytelling.  And then it becomes a book that leaves you scraping your jaw off the ground as you watch people cooly making completely unethical decisions. The quandaries faced in this book reminded me of the mystery I read earlier this year, _Defending Jacob_, where the narrator's son is on trial for committing murder and the family has to grapple with whether he is guilty or not, despite the public face they put on for the trial.  Both books also touch on psychopathy, which adds a fascinating and frightening angle to the crimes and the families themselves. As a closing note, it was interesting to learn that this book was much better received in Europe than in the United States--apparently the average American reader is much more interested in a story that has likable characters and more cathartic closure.
