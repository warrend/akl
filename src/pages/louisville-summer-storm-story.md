i promised my mom i'd rescue the cushions  
from our covered porch.  
  
but instead i curled up  
i mean i am curled up  
watching the the birth of a storm, announced:  
layers of water  
landing on the pond, the yard  
darting through the drainpipe  
dripping off the birches  
and thunder keeping time  
  
i risked it all ending without me  
to make some english breakfast tea  
and now this.  
this. is perfect.  
  
a couple chipmunks taking cover near me,  
watching wearily  
and seven sparrows playing out on the grass  
some petals fall down  
because they are delicate  
and the rain is heavy.
