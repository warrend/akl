I read [Bel Canto](http://akindoflibrary.com/bel-canto/) years ago and have had a number of Ann Patchett's books on my to-read list, but didn't realize until this morning that I never picked any of them up. Â One of my cousins recommended her recent book of essays, a collection of the nonfiction she's written over the years for various magazines, called _This is the Story of a Happy Marriage_.
