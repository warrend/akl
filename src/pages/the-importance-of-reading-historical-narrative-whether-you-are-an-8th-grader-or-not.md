I recently started a graduate program and have been reminded of just how much I enjoy nerding out.  My class is on Tuesday nights and for the past three weeks since it started I have spent my Wednesday and Friday nights reading and writing for it--and enjoying it.  I was last in graduate school for English education nine years ago, and I have to say that reading professional books while being an active, experienced teacher is so much more engaging.  Before I was reading all of these theories and philosophies but without a real way into the conversation.  This time around I have 95 current students and 700 previous ones to think about as well as structures I've put into place to grow them as readers and writers--and reading the books is making me think and dream a bit bigger about what a gift it is to teach reading and writing and reminding me that I haven't figured it all out yet.

I am currently in the middle of a Holocaust Literature book club with students--I have a group of 5-8 in each class reading _Maus_ by Art Spiegelman and _Night_ by Elie Wiesel over the course of 5 weeks.  (I've written previously about book club experiences with students here: [_Maus_ and _Night_](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2012/03/maus-and-night-think-through-wwii-and.html) and _[Harry Potter](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2010/11/on-harry-potter-and-another-reason-why.html)._) It never ceases to amaze me how 8th graders approach and handle such serious texts.  What I've come to realize while reading great books with small groups of students is that 13 and 14 year old students are aching to talk about and be trusted with serious topics.  Instead of nervous about handing titles like _Maus_ and _Night_ to them, I frame it with the context that learning about difficult times in the past is best done in community and that reading, reflecting, talking, and writing about them is one of the best ways to process through the stories that have come before us and to equip us in becoming educated, sensitive people when we walk out into our own lives.  
  
This is where my reading for graduate school comes in.  One evening after our first _Maus_ book club meeting I read: "_History is about people who were products of their time and their own intricately woven value systems.  Literature study enhances our appreciation of history's complexity, which in turn expands our appreciation of present political complexities and better equips us to predict and prepare for the future.  History gives us statistics; literature lets us experience the human tragedy_." (Teaching Children's Literature: It's Critical, Leland, Lewison, Harste)  
  
This is especially fitting for our reading of _Maus_ because it is Spiegelman telling not only the story of his father's survival of the Holocaust, but it is also the story of Spiegelman himself grappling with his family's history and how it shaped his present while writing the book.  In turn, the reader is able to contextualize multiple lines of history, feel pain over the fact that this is a true story, and ask questions about their present time and life.  I cannot more strongly believe that historical study must be paired with narrative if students today are to grow into educated citizens who can see nuance and complexity rather, who can ask questions and dialogue, who can be people who understand statistics but also tap into the real people represented by those numbers.  
  
Spiegelman ends the World War Two storyline of _Maus_ with a scene we as readers know from the beginning happens--the reunion of his parents post-Auschwitz.  We ended our conversation by asking why he would end the story in this way and if we were to have any hope as we move forward as people.  What we came up with is that love can still win--and despite the fact that most were not as lucky as Vladek and Anja Spiegelman, and despite the fact that human history still remains quite ugly, that perhaps the threads of goodness can restore and heal the human spirit.  And, perhaps, that by remembering both that and the historical details, readers can imagine a different kind of future.
