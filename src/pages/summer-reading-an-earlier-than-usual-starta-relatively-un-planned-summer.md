Generally, I am a planner.  I remember dates.  I use a calendar (albeit, I did switch to a digital one, mostly to avoid unnecessary clutter).  For summer reading, [I always have a plan](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/search/label/summer%20reading).  Granted, summer reading isn't that unlike my usual reading life, as I always have a book on hand.  The only added bonus is more time, thanks to being employed by the NYC Department of Education.  Anyway.  My [book club](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/search/label/book%20club) (read: me and my one friend) got ambitious and we are tackling [Infinite Jest](http://infinitesummer.org/archives/215) by David Foster Wallace this summer.  This is an undertaking that I want to take seriously, therefore I am not making a list longer than the following:

Infinite Jest/DFW  
Bossypants/Tina Fey

Of course I have other hopes for my summer.  Apparently Hamlet is a frequent allusion in _Infinite Jest_, so I may spend some time with Shakespeare.  Or wikipedia.  I'm also interested in _A Visit from the Goon Squad_ by Jennifer Egan.  I am craving some rereads: [Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/search/label/harry%20potter) (yes I just read it in the fall. And? The last movie is in July and I intend to make the most of the end of this era), [The Summer Book](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2010/08/my-favorite-summer-book-of-all-time-i.html) and [Anne of Green Gables](http://akindoflibrary.blogspot.com/2009/10/anne-shirley-youre-my-hero.html).  Other than that, I will see where the wind takes me.  I'm sure there are many of you who are laughing at my planned un-plan.  Sigh.  It's a start. And the best part is that I'm starting my summer reading plan a month before my official summer starts, so it's like a bonus month!

I am curious: what are your most recent reading loves? I have some time and there is nothing better than a book well-recommended by a friend.
