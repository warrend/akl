It is at once a movie and a song and makes your heart hurt, in the best of ways and in the most painful of ways. But don't watch it too early in the day, otherwise you won't know what to do with yourself until you go to bed because it will haunt your thoughts. But there really aren't words, so that's all I can leave you with.
